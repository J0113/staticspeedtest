JSpeedtest
======

JavaScript Speedtest is an internet download speedtest made using pure JavaScript and HTML, fully static. It can be hosted on Github Pages or any other host that accepts JavaScript and HTML.

Note: This is an early version, the code is messy and needs to get cleaned. I'm working on creating a JS file so it can be used easy, as soon as that is done you will be able to create your own version (Please wait the current code is not easy to use and horrible written!).

DL Speedtest HTTPS
------

Because github does not allow files bigger than 30MB, needed to test fast internet connections, I've hosted them on my webserver (Cloudflare HTTPS). You may use these files however you want, don't **ab**use!
