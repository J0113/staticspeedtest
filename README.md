# JSpeedtest

JavaScript Speedtest is an internet download speedtest made using pure JavaScript and HTML, fully static. It can be hosted on Github Pages or any other host that accepts JavaScript and HTML.

Note: This is an early version, the code is messy and needs to get cleaned. I want to create an standalone JS file later!
